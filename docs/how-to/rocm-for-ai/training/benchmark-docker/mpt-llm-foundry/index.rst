******************************************
Training MPT-30B with LLM Foundry and ROCm
******************************************

MPT-30B is a 30-billion parameter decoder-style transformer-based model from
the Mosaic Pretrained Transformer (MPT) family -- learn more about it in
MosaicML's research blog `MPT-30B: Raising the bar for open-source foundation
models <https://www.databricks.com/blog/mpt-30b>`_.

ROCm and `<https://github.com/ROCm/MAD>`__ provide a pre-configured training
environment for the MPT-30B model using the ``rocm/pytorch-training:v25.5``
base `Docker image <https://hub.docker.com/layers/rocm/pytorch-training/v25.5/images/sha256-d47850a9b25b4a7151f796a8d24d55ea17bba545573f0d50d54d3852f96ecde5>`_
and the `LLM Foundry <https://github.com/mosaicml/llm-foundry>`_ framework.
This environment packages the following software components to train
on AMD Instinct MI300X series accelerators:

+--------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Software component       | Version                        |
+==========================+================================+
| ROCm                     | 6.3.4                          |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------+
| PyTorch                  | 2.7.0a0+git6374332             |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Flash Attention          | 3.0.0.post1                    |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------+

Using this image, you can build, run, and test the training process
for MPT-30B with access to detailed logs and performance metrics.

System validation
=================

If you have already validated your system settings, including NUMA
auto-balancing, skip this step. Otherwise, complete the :ref:`system validation
and optimization steps <train-a-model-system-validation>` to set up your system
before starting training.

Getting started
===============

The following procedures help you set up the training environment in a
reproducible Docker container. This training environment is tailored for
training MPT-30B using LLM Foundry and the specific model configurations outlined.
Other configurations and run conditions outside those described in this
document are not validated.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: MAD-integrated benchmarking

      On your host machine, clone the ROCm Model Automation and Dashboarding
      (`<https://github.com/ROCm/MAD>`__) repository to a local directory and
      install the required packages.

      .. code-block:: shell

         git clone https://github.com/ROCm/MAD
         cd MAD
         pip install -r requirements.txt

      Use this command to initiate the MPT-30B training benchmark.

      .. code-block:: shell

         python3 tools/run_models.py --tags pyt_mpt30b_training --keep-model-dir --live-output --clean-docker-cache

      .. tip::

         If you experience data download failures, set the
         ``MAD_SECRETS_HFTOKEN`` variable to your Hugging Face access token. See
         `User access tokens <https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens>`_
         for details.

         .. code-block:: shell

            export MAD_SECRETS_HFTOKEN="your personal Hugging Face token to access gated models"

      .. note::

         For improved performance (training throughput), consider enabling TunableOp.
         By default, ``pyt_mpt30b_training`` runs with TunableOp disabled. To enable it,
         run ``tools/run_models.py`` with the ``--tunableop on`` argument or edit the
         ``models.json`` configuration before running training.

         Although this might increase the initial training time, it can result in a performance gain.

   .. tab-item:: Standalone benchmarking

      To set up the training environment, clone the
      `<https://github.com/ROCm/MAD>`__ repo and build the Docker image. In
      this snippet, the image is named ``mosaic_mpt30_image``.

      .. code-block:: shell

         git clone https://github.com/ROCm/MAD
         cd MAD

         docker build --build-arg MAD_SYSTEM_GPU_ARCHITECTURE=gfx942 -f docker/pyt_mpt30b_training.ubuntu.amd.Dockerfile -t mosaic_mpt30_image .

      Start a ``mosaic_mpt30_image`` container using the following command.

      .. code-block:: shell

         docker run -it --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --group-add=video --ipc=host --shm-size=8G mosaic_mpt30_image

      In the Docker container, clone the `<https://github.com/ROCm/MAD>`__
      repository and navigate to the benchmark scripts directory at
      ``/workspace/MAD/scripts/pyt_mpt30b_training``.

      .. code-block:: shell

         git clone https://github.com/ROCm/MAD
         cd MAD/scripts/pyt_mpt30b_training

      To initiate the training process, use the following command. This script uses the hyperparameters defined in
      ``mpt-30b-instruct.yaml``.

      .. code-block:: shell

         source run.sh

      .. note::

         For improved performance (training throughput), consider enabling TunableOp.
         To enable it, add the ``--tunableop on`` flag.

         .. code-block:: shell

            source run.sh --tunableop on

         Although this might increase the initial training time, it can result in a performance gain.

Interpreting the output
=======================

The training output will be displayed in the terminal and simultaneously saved
to the ``output.txt`` file in the current directory. Key performance metrics will
also be extracted and appended to the ``perf_pyt_mpt30b_training.csv`` file.

Key performance metrics include:

- Training logs: Real-time display of loss metrics, accuracy, and training progress.

- Model checkpoints: Periodically saved model snapshots for potential resume or evaluation.

- Performance metrics: Detailed summaries of training speed and training loss metrics.

  - Performance (throughput/samples_per_sec)

    Overall throughput, measuring the total samples processed per second. Higher values indicate better hardware utilization.

  - Performance per device (throughput/samples_per_sec)

    Throughput on a per-device basis, showing how each GPU or CPU is performing.

  - Language Cross Entropy (metrics/train/LanguageCrossEntropy)

    Measures prediction accuracy. Lower cross entropy suggests the model’s output is closer to the expected distribution.

  - Training loss (loss/train/total)

    Overall training loss. A decreasing trend indicates the model is learning effectively.
